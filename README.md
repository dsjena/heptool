# HEP Tools

Software tool usually used in HEP and EHEP community. This list is not the complete list of all software. However, this list are gradually evolving software list. It all started for students to keep very basic level of introduction and particularly towards the installation where student face lot of issues. 

I invite every one to share the tools/script which can help to student for the same. 

A paragraph of introduction have been directly taken from the respective pages without modification (without disturbing the actual information)

# autotools 

source https://www.lrde.epita.fr/~adl/autotools.html

If you are new to Automake, maybe you know that it is part of a set of tools called The Autotools. Maybe you’ve already delved into a package full of files named configure, configure.ac, Makefile.in, Makefile.am, aclocal.m4, …, some of them claiming to be generated by Autoconf or Automake. But the exact purpose of these files and their relations is probably fuzzy. The goal of this chapter is to introduce you to this machinery, to show you how it works and how powerful it is. If you’ve never installed or seen such a package, do not worry: this chapter will walk you through it.

If you need some teaching material, more illustrations, or a less automake-centered continuation, some slides for this introduction are available in Alexandre Duret-Lutz’s Autotools Tutorial. This chapter is the written version of the first part of his tutorial. 

# boost 

source https://www.boost.org/

Boost provides free peer-reviewed portable C++ source libraries.

We emphasize libraries that work well with the C++ Standard Library. Boost libraries are intended to be widely useful, and usable across a broad spectrum of applications. The Boost license encourages the use of Boost libraries for all users with minimal restrictions.

We aim to establish "existing practice" and provide reference implementations so that Boost libraries are suitable for eventual standardization. Beginning with the ten Boost Libraries included in the Library Technical Report (TR1) and continuing with every release of the ISO standard for C++ since 2011, the C++ Standards Committee has continued to rely on Boost as a valuable source for additions to the Standard C++ Library.
